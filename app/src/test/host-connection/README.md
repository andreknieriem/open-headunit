# Connection lifecycle regressions

Run `python3 app/src/test/host-connection/run.py` after populating Gradle's Kotlin dependencies.
The runner extracts production lifecycle methods and uses JVM queues and latches to exercise
cancellation, ownership publication, full worker termination and USB open/close races.
Android framework and I/O endpoints are test doubles; no device is needed.

When the playback host suite is present, the runner also exercises the settings/publication
boundary with the real AapAudio and AudioDecoder owners. This optional integration check
retains standalone execution of the connection PR without a playback dependency.
